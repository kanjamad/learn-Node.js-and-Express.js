Node.js + Express.js

Time to learn Node.js

Node is JavaScript that runs on my machine. Up until Node was created I could only run JavaScript in the browser because the browsers were the only ones that had a JavaScript engine like V8 and Node JS was created with the V8  engine in order to be able to run JavaScript anywhere including my computer including on robots and anywhere as long as I had Node JS.
Node is most popular for building servers. Itâ€™s really fast
The server of choice for any web apps or mobile apps out there to create an API or server. And great for building chat application, realtime communication.
